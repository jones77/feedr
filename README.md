## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (install from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/))

### Using Cargo Install (Recommended)
```bash
cargo install feedr
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)
Feedr is available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/feedr). Install it using your preferred AUR helper:
```bash
paru -S feedr
# or
yay -S feedr
```

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bahdotsh/feedr.git
cd feedr
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/feedr`.

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
feedr
```

### OPML Import

Import feeds from an OPML file:
```bash
feedr --import feeds.opml
```

### Configuration Management

View and modify settings from the command line:
```bash
feedr config list                      # List all settings with current values
feedr config get ui.theme              # Get a single value
feedr config set ui.theme light        # Set a value (with validation)
feedr config --tui                     # Open interactive TUI config editor
```

Available config keys use dot-notation (e.g. `general.max_dashboard_items`, `network.http_timeout`, `ui.theme`, `ui.compact_mode`). Run `feedr config list` to see all keys. Feed management (`default_feeds`) is only available through the TUI editor.

### Quick Start
1. When you open Feedr for the first time, press `a` to add a feed
2. Enter a valid RSS feed URL (e.g., `https://news.ycombinator.com/rss`)
3. You can also press `1`, `2`, or `3` to quickly add Hacker News, TechCrunch, or BBC News
4. Use arrow keys (or `j`/`k`) to navigate and `Enter` to view items
5. Press `o` to open the current article in your browser
6. Press `t` to toggle between dark and light themes

## Configuration

Feedr supports customization through a TOML configuration file that follows XDG Base Directory specifications. You can edit the file directly, use `feedr config get/set` from the command line, or use `feedr config --tui` for an interactive editor.

### Configuration File Location

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/feedr/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\feedr\config.toml`

The configuration file is automatically generated with default values on first run if it doesn't exist.

### Available Settings

```toml
# Feedr Configuration File

[general]
max_dashboard_items = 100           # Maximum number of items shown on dashboard
auto_refresh_interval = 0           # Auto-refresh interval in seconds (0 = disabled)
refresh_enabled = false             # Enable automatic background refresh
refresh_rate_limit_delay = 2000     # Delay in milliseconds between requests to same domain

[network]
http_timeout = 15              # HTTP request timeout in seconds
user_agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Feedr/1.0; +https://github.com/bahdotsh/feedr)"

[ui]
tick_rate = 100                # UI update rate in milliseconds
error_display_timeout = 3000   # Error message duration in milliseconds
theme = "dark"                 # Theme: "dark" (cyberpunk) or "light" (zen)
compact_mode = "auto"          # Compact layout: "auto", "always", or "never"

# Optional: Define default feeds to load on first run
[[default_feeds]]
url = "https://example.com/feed.xml"
category = "News"

# Authenticated feed with custom HTTP headers
[[default_feeds]]
url = "https://private.example.com/feed.xml"
[default_feeds.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer your_token_here"
```

### Configuration Options Explained

#### General Settings
- **max_dashboard_items**: Controls how many items are displayed on the dashboard (default: 100)
- **auto_refresh_interval**: Automatically refresh feeds at specified interval in seconds (0 disables auto-refresh)
- **refresh_enabled**: Master switch to enable/disable automatic background refresh (default: false)
- **refresh_rate_limit_delay**: Delay in milliseconds between requests to the same domain to prevent "too many requests" errors (default: 2000ms). This is especially useful for Reddit feeds and other rate-limited services.

#### Network Settings
- **http_timeout**: Timeout for HTTP requests when fetching feeds (useful for slow connections)
- **user_agent**: Custom User-Agent string for HTTP requests

#### UI Settings
- **tick_rate**: How frequently the UI updates in milliseconds (lower = more responsive, higher = less CPU usage)
- **error_display_timeout**: How long error messages are displayed in milliseconds
- **theme**: Choose between `"dark"` (cyberpunk aesthetic with neon colors) or `"light"` (zen minimalist with organic colors). Can also be toggled at runtime with `t`.
- **compact_mode**: Controls the compact layout for small terminals. `"auto"` (default) enables compact mode when terminal height is ≤30 rows, `"always"` forces compact mode, and `"never"` disables it. Compact mode uses single-line items, a minimal title bar, and an abbreviated help bar to maximize screen real estate.

#### Background Refresh Example
To enable automatic refresh every 5 minutes with rate limiting:
```toml
[general]
refresh_enabled = true
auto_refresh_interval = 300  # 5 minutes
refresh_rate_limit_delay = 2000  # 2 seconds between requests to same domain
```

**Note**: Rate limiting groups feeds by domain and staggers requests to prevent hitting API limits. For example, if you have multiple Reddit feeds, they will be fetched with a 2-second delay between each request to avoid getting blocked.

#### Default Feeds
You can define feeds to be automatically loaded on first run:
```toml
[[default_feeds]]
url = "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss"
category = "Tech"

[[default_feeds]]
url = "https://example.com/feed.xml"
category = "News"
```

#### Authenticated Feeds
Some RSS feeds require authentication or custom HTTP headers. You can configure per-feed headers:
```toml
[[default_feeds]]
url = "https://private.example.com/feed.xml"
[default_feeds.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer your_api_token"

[[default_feeds]]
url = "https://another-api.example.com/rss"
[default_feeds.headers]
X-API-Key = "your_api_key"
Cookie = "session=abc123"
```
Headers are sent with every request for that feed, including refreshes.

### External-Command Hooks

Feedr supports newsboat-style external commands for two workflows: **macros** (key-triggered chains that act on the focused article) and **`exec_on_new`** (a notification hook fired per newly-seen item after each refresh).

**Commands are not run through a shell.** Templates are tokenized once at config load, and `%X` placeholders are substituted into individual `argv` tokens — feed content can never break out of an argument. For pipes, redirection, or globbing, write a small shell script and invoke that.

#### Template Variables

Expanded in every `argv` token of macro and hook commands:

| Variable | Expands to |
|----------|------------|
| `%t` | Article title |
| `%u` | Article URL |
| `%a` | Author |
| `%d` | Formatted publish date |
| `%f` | Feed title |
| `%F` | Feed URL |
| `%%` | Literal `%` |

#### Macros

A macro binds a key to an ordered chain of steps. Trigger with `<prefix><key>` (default prefix is `,`). Steps are separated by `;`. An optional trailing ` -- "description"` overrides the help-overlay label.

```toml
[macros]
y = 'open-in-browser ; pipe-to "yt-dlp %u"'
w = 'pipe-to "wallabag-cli add %u" -- "Save to Wallabag"'
n = 'pipe-to "tee /tmp/out.txt" stdin=metadata'

[macro_options]
prefix = ","                  # the macro-prefix key
pipe_default_stdin = "body"   # body | title | url | metadata | none
```

**Step kinds:**
- `<action>` — invoke a built-in action. Supported in macros: `open-in-browser`, `toggle-star`, `toggle-read`, `mark-all-read`, `refresh`, `toggle-theme`, `extract-links`, `help`.
- `pipe-to "cmd %u" [stdin=…]` — suspend the TUI, run the command, and pipe article content to its stdin. `stdin` is one of `body` (default), `title`, `url`, `metadata`, or `none`.
- `exec "cmd %u"` — spawn the command detached (no stdin, no terminal takeover).

Chains halt on the first step error. Press `Esc` after the prefix to cancel; an unbound follow-up surfaces a "No macro bound" error. Macros are also rendered in the help overlay (`?`).

#### `exec_on_new` Notifications

Fire a command once per newly-seen item after each refresh. The first successful fetch of each feed seeds the seen-set silently — you do **not** get a firehose on initial load or first run.

```toml
[hooks]
exec_on_new = 'notify-send "New: %t" "%f"'
```

Children are spawned **detached** so the TUI never blocks on them. Crash semantics are **at-most-once**: feedr persists the seen-set before spawning, so a kill mid-fire loses a notification rather than re-firing on the next launch. Prefer idempotent commands (e.g. `wallabag-cli add` is safe; `mail-me` is not).

#### Security Notes

- The shell is never invoked, so feed content in `%t` / `%a` / etc. cannot escape an argument.
- **Do not wrap your command in `sh -c "... %t ..."`** — that reintroduces shell injection through item titles. Write a script file and invoke it instead.
- `~` / `$HOME` / `$VAR` are **not** expanded — use absolute paths.
- If a macro's command template has unbalanced quotes or names an unknown action, feedr surfaces a startup warning rather than failing silently at trigger time.

### Configurable Keybindings

Remap any action by adding a `[keybindings]` section to your config file. Each action can be bound to a single key string or an array of keys:

```toml
[keybindings]
quit = "x"                          # Single key
move_up = ["Up", "k", "w"]         # Multiple keys
force_quit = "Ctrl+x"              # Modifier keys
toggle_theme = "F5"                # Function keys
```

**Available actions:**

| `toggle_expand` | `Space` | Expand/collapse in tree view |
| `next_tab` | `Tab` | Next view |
| `prev_tab` | `Shift+Tab` | Previous view |

**Supported key formats:** Single characters (`q`, `?`, `/`), special keys (`Enter`, `Space`, `Tab`, `Esc`, `Backspace`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Delete`, `F1`–`F5`), and modifier combos (`Ctrl+q`, `Shift+Tab`, `Alt+x`).

### Data Storage

Feedr stores your bookmarks, categories, read/unread state, and starred articles in:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.local/share/feedr/feedr_data.json`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\feedr\feedr_data.json`

### Backwards Compatibility

Feedr automatically migrates data from older versions to the new XDG-compliant locations. Your existing data will be preserved and automatically moved to the correct location on first run.
